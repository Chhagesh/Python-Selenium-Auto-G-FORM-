Here's a clear documentation of the Selenium automation approach used in selenium.py:

Setup and Configuration
Uses Chrome WebDriver with maximized window setting
Implements explicit waits (20 seconds timeout) for reliable element detection
Handles browser cleanup through try-finally block
Form Automation Flow
Navigates to the specified Google Form URL
Systematically fills form fields in sequence:
Personal details (name, contact, email)
Address information (full address, pin code)
Additional details (DOB, gender, verification code)
Uses strategic delays between actions for stability
Takes confirmation screenshot after submission
Key Technical Elements
Leverages XPath selectors for precise element targeting
Uses WebDriverWait for robust element detection
Implements JavaScript click execution for reliable form submission
Captures final state through screenshot functionality
Error Handling
Ensures browser cleanup even if errors occur
Uses explicit waits to handle dynamic loading
Implements proper element presence verification
This automation script provides a reliable way to fill out the Google Form with specific user details while maintaining stability and error handling.
